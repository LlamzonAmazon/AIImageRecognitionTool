# AIImageRecognitionTool
An AI-powered image recognition tool with cloud functionality via AWS.

This is a personal endeavor. I am interested in cloud computing and AI. So, I am going to undertake a personal project that combines these two interests of mine in a seemingly simple manner. Hopefully, by the end of this project I have improved my front-end development skills, gained valuable experience with AWS, and learned how to integrate AI in a web-based service. 

I am excited for what I will learn during this project. There will certainly be a lot of failure and learning, but no one ever learned anything without failure right?
