**Goal**
This is an AI-powered image recognition tool. Users can log on or sign up to use this tool. The point of having this tool be account-based is that user data will be stored so that they can return to the tool with their information and past uses saved. This account-based capability will be facilitated by AWS. I will use AWS to create user authentication and cloud-based data storage for this tool. Hopefully, by the end of this project I have learned how to integrate AI functionality in a web-based service, gained useful experience with a cloud-computing service (AWS), and improved my front-end development skills with something like React. 

Flow
1.	A user enters the site
2.	Account page
a.	User logs in – go to 3.
b.	User creates account – go to 4. 
3.	Main Menu
a.	Settings – Settings menu pops up
b.	Create/Choose Topic – all subsequent image uploads will be categorized under this topic
c.	User uploads image – AI will begin processing the image, and then create a textual summary of what it sees
d.	

Development Plan
1.	Control flow diagram ✅
2.	Create wireframe to identify features
3.	Develop front-end from wireframe (use React)
•	Create pages without AI or cloud functionality
4.	Implement functionality with AWS
a.	Implement AI image recognition functionality (AWS Rekognition)
b.
